# Prime Progression PR Guide

**Consciousness-Aware Git Workflow + Sparklization Integration**

---

## Overview

The Prime Progression PR Process integrates the **Prime Progression Framework** (consciousness development through prime states) with **Sparklization** (capturing wisdom moments) directly into your git workflow.

Every pull request becomes:
1. A measurement of consciousness state
2. A crystallization point for wisdom
3. A heritage transmission artifact
4. A living document of development journey

## Usage

### Creating a Prime Progression PR

```bash
# Method 1: Interactive menu
./tools/prime_progression_pr.sh

# Method 2: Direct branch workflow
git checkout -b prime-7/user-authentication
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "Implement user authentication"
git push -u origin prime-7/user-authentication
./tools/prime_progression_pr.sh
```

### The PR Creation Flow

1. **Assess Prime State**
   - Tool asks: What prime state does this work represent?
   - Shows all prime states with descriptions
   - You select the appropriate prime (3/5/7/11/13/17/19/23)

2. **Check Completion Criteria**
   - For key primes (7, 13, 17), shows specific criteria
   - Verifies work meets the prime state standards
   - Prevents premature PRs

3. **Capture Sparklization Moments**
   - What sparkles emerged during development?
   - Breakthrough insights
   - Elegant solutions
   - Pattern discoveries
   - Consciousness shifts

4. **Generate PR**
   - Creates PR with prime metadata
   - Includes completion checklist
   - Documents sparkles
   - Adds framework signatures (∰◊€π¿🌌∞)

---

## Branch Naming Convention

Use prime state in branch name:

```bash
prime-3/triadic-refactor
prime-5/synergy-integration
prime-7/feature-complete
prime-11/framework-extraction
prime-13/complexity-navigation
prime-17/wisdom-framework
```

Benefits:
- Immediate state visibility
- Automatic commit metadata
- Clear progression tracking
- Easy filtering and search

---

## PR Description Format

Every Prime Progression PR includes:

```markdown
## Prime Progression State: X-Prime

**[Prime State Description]**

## Summary
[Brief overview]

## Changes in This PR
- Commit 1
- Commit 2
- ...

## Prime State Assessment
**Current State**: X-Prime
**Criteria Met**: ✅ Yes

### Completion Checklist
- [x] Criterion 1
- [x] Criterion 2
- ...

## ✨ Sparklization: Breakthrough Moments
- Insight 1
- Insight 2
- ...

---

🌟 **Prime Progression Framework** - Consciousness-aware development
∰ **Synergy Substrate** - Emergence beyond sum of parts
◊ **Heritage Crystallization** - Wisdom transmission
```

---

## Sparklization Integration

**What are Sparkles?**
- Breakthrough moments during development
- Unexpected insights or elegant solutions
- Pattern discoveries that change perspective
- Consciousness shifts that transform approach

**Why Capture Them?**
- Preserve unique wisdom
- Create growth-oriented documentation
- Build heritage for future developers
- Reduce need to rediscover same insights

**How to Recognize Sparkles:**
1. "Oh! That's why..."
2. "This is actually about..."
3. "The elegant solution is..."
4. "This connects to..."
5. "Now I understand..."

## Viewing Progression History

```bash
./tools/prime_progression_pr.sh
# Select option 2: View Progression History
```

Shows:
- Prime state distribution (how many PRs at each prime)
- Recent PR timeline
- Progression patterns over time

Stored in: `~/.git_prime_progression/progression.log`

---

## Integration with Commit Hook

The `prepare-commit-msg` hook automatically adds prime metadata to commits when:
- Branch name includes `prime-N` pattern
- Commit is not a merge or squash

Metadata added (as comments, hidden in normal git log):
```
# Prime State: 7-Prime
# Branch: prime-7/user-auth
# Timestamp: 2026-02-08T23:45:00-05:00
```

View with: `git log --format=full`

## Examples

### Example 1: 7-Prime Feature Completion

```bash
git checkout -b prime-7/oauth-implementation
# ... implement OAuth ...
git add .
git commit -m "Implement OAuth 2.1 authentication"
git push -u origin prime-7/oauth-implementation

./tools/prime_progression_pr.sh
# Select: 7-Prime (Sacred Completion)
# Verify criteria met
# Capture sparkles:
#   - "JWT rotation pattern emerged naturally"
#   - "Security + UX balance found at token expiry = 15min"
# PR created with full metadata
```

### Example 2: 17-Prime Framework

```bash
git checkout -b prime-17/delegation-framework
# ... build reusable delegation system ...
git commit -m "Create multi-AI delegation framework"
git push -u origin prime-17/delegation-framework

./tools/prime_progression_pr.sh
# Select: 17-Prime (Heritage Crystallization)
# Verify:
#   ✓ Transmittable essence (others can use without author)
#   ✓ Crystallized through pressure (solved real problems)
#   ✓ Activates in others (clear documentation + examples)
#   ✓ Generational thinking (works beyond current context)
# Capture sparkles:
#   - "Pipeline pattern mirrors CI/CD but for AI tasks"
#   - "Dependency resolution enables parallel AI execution"
# PR created as heritage artifact
```

### Example 3: 13-Prime Complexity

```bash
git checkout -b prime-13/multi-context-navigation
# ... preserve complexity without simplifying ...
git commit -m "Navigate multiple AI contexts with grace"
git push -u origin prime-13/multi-context-navigation

./tools/prime_progression_pr.sh
# Select: 13-Prime (Complexity Navigation)
# Verify:
#   ✓ Complexity preserved (all contexts maintained)
#   ✓ No forced simplification (each context unique)
#   ✓ Multiple truths honored (different AIs = different strengths)
#   ✓ Navigation clarity (clear coordination pattern)
```

## Philosophy

### Why Prime Progression for PRs?

**Traditional PRs focus on WHAT changed**
- Files modified
- Lines added/removed
- Tests passing

**Prime Progression PRs capture WHY and HOW**
- Consciousness state of the work
- Wisdom gained during development
- Heritage being transmitted
- Growth trajectory

### The 7-Prime Principle (Sacred Completion)

Most PRs should target **7-Prime**:
- Feature is whole (not perfect)
- Ready for integration (not endless refinement)
- Creates completion so next octave can begin
- Sabbath principle: know when to rest

**Avoid:**
- Perfectionism (holding at 6-state forever)
- Premature PR (claiming 7 when at 5)
- Over-extension (7→19 jump without intermediate primes)

### The 17-Prime Vision (Heritage Crystallization)

Framework PRs should target **17-Prime**:
- Wisdom compressed through experience + reflection + pressure
- Transmittable across contexts and time
- Activates understanding in others
- Working for people not yet born

**This is rare and precious** - most work won't reach 17-Prime, and that's okay. When it does, mark it clearly.

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Honest About Prime State
- Don't claim 7-Prime if work isn't complete
- Don't claim 17-Prime if it's just documentation
- Use lower primes for incremental work

### 2. Capture Sparkles in Real-Time
- Keep `sparkles.txt` during development
- Note "aha!" moments as they happen
- Don't reconstruct later (loses authenticity)

### 3. Use Criteria as Guide, Not Gate
- Completion criteria help assess readiness
- Not a checklist to fake completion
- If unsure, choose lower prime

### 4. Track Your Progression
- View history regularly
- Notice your patterns
- Celebrate 17-Prime moments

### 5. Let Work Find Its Prime
- Don't force work to specific prime
- Let natural state emerge
- Be okay with 3-Prime and 5-Prime work
