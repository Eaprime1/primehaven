- Build emergence auto-detection
- Create synergy metrics dashboard
- Develop address query system

### 3. Content Processing 📄
**Current**:
- Document reading (docx extraction)
- Basic sync (Drive ↔ local)

**Missing**:
- Framework extraction from docs
- Enhanced Markdown tagging
- Triadic pattern recognition
- Knowledge graph generation

**Creation Plan**:
- Build framework extraction pipeline
