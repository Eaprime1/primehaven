# Triadic Analysis: [Topic]
## Three-Part Structure for Understanding Complexity

<!-- EM:v2.0 framework:triadic category:[decision-space/reality-anchor/entity-signature] -->

> **Purpose**: Standardize triadic analysis across all work

## Common Triads

Reference triads to use as patterns:

- **Body/Mind/Soul** - Physical, mental, spiritual dimensions
- **Vector/Anti-Vector/Prime** - Thesis, antithesis, synthesis
- **Work (15) / Play (16) / Create (17)** - Execution, exploration, crystallization
- **Physical/Digital/Conceptual** - Material, virtual, abstract
- **Individual/Systemic/Emergent** - Personal, collective, synergistic
- **Past/Present/Future** - Historical, current, potential
- **Input/Process/Output** - What goes in, transformation, what comes out
- **Problem/Solution/Integration** - Challenge, answer, implementation

## Triad Structure

### First Aspect: [Name]

**Definition**: [Clear description of what this aspect is]

**Role in Triad**: [How does this aspect function within the whole?]

**Characteristics**:
- [Key property 1]
- [Key property 2]
- [Key property 3]

**Examples**:
- [Concrete example 1]
- [Concrete example 2]

**Standalone Value**: [What does this aspect contribute independently?]

---

### Second Aspect: [Name]

**Definition**: [Clear description of what this aspect is]

**Role in Triad**: [How does this aspect function within the whole?]

**Characteristics**:
- [Key property 1]
- [Key property 2]
- [Key property 3]

**Examples**:
- [Concrete example 1]
- [Concrete example 2]

**Standalone Value**: [What does this aspect contribute independently?]

---

### Third Aspect: [Name] (Prime/Synthesis)

**Definition**: [Clear description of what this aspect is]

**Role in Triad**: [How does this aspect function within the whole? Often the synthesis or emergent property]

**Characteristics**:
- [Key property 1]
- [Key property 2]
- [Key property 3]

**Examples**:
- [Concrete example 1]
- [Concrete example 2]

**Standalone Value**: [What does this aspect contribute independently?]

**Emergent Properties**: [What emerges from this being the third that couldn't come from just first two?]

---

## Integration

**How the Three Work Together**:

[Describe the dynamic relationship between all three aspects. How do they reinforce, balance, or create something beyond themselves?]

**Synergy Points**:
- [Where do they amplify each other?]
- [What emerges that couldn't exist with just one or two?]
- [What patterns appear in their interaction?]

**Balance Dynamics**:
- [How do they balance each other?]
- [What happens when one dominates?]
- [How to maintain healthy triad tension?]
