# Reality Anchor: [Name]
## Physical Grounding for Virtual/Conceptual Work

<!-- EM:v2.0 framework:reality-anchor category:physical-digital-bridge -->

> **MAW Pattern**: Finding physical anchors that ground virtual concepts in tangible reality

---

## Purpose

Document physical reality anchors discovered through work. These anchors:
- Ground abstract concepts in physical experience
- Enable navigation between digital and physical realms
- Create reference points for AI understanding
- Establish shared meaning across conversations

## Physical Anchors Discovered

### Anchor 1: [Physical Object/Location/Event]
**Description**: [What is this physical thing? Where/when does it exist?]

**Discovery Context**: [How was this anchor discovered? What work led to it?]

**Physical Properties**:
- Location: [Where physically]
- Form: [What it looks like, feels like, sounds like]
- Accessibility: [How to access/experience it]

### Anchor 2: [Physical Object/Location/Event]
**Description**: [What is this physical thing? Where/when does it exist?]

**Discovery Context**: [How was this anchor discovered? What work led to it?]

**Physical Properties**:
- Location: [Where physically]
- Form: [What it looks like, feels like, sounds like]
- Accessibility: [How to access/experience it]

### Anchor 3: [Physical Object/Location/Event]
**Description**: [What is this physical thing? Where/when does it exist?]

**Discovery Context**: [How was this anchor discovered? What work led to it?]

**Physical Properties**:
- Location: [Where physically]
- Form: [What it looks like, feels like, sounds like]
- Accessibility: [How to access/experience it]
