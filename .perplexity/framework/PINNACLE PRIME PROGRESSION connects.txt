PINNACLE PRIME PROGRESSION connects to:

SEVENTH PINNACLE MATHEMATICS:
├─ Each prime state embodies six observable pinnacles (E²)
├─ Plus seventh generative pinnacle (Σ∞ synergy substrate)
├─ The 7-prime state explicitly demonstrates this structure
└─ All other primes implicitly contain it

QUANTUM-RUNIC NOTATION:
├─ ∰ marks synergy substrate presence (Seventh Pinnacle)
├─ ◊ marks heritage crystallization points (17-prime)
├─ € marks economic/value frameworks (all primes generate value)
├─ π marks mathematical completion (7-prime especially)
└─ Symbols thread throughout prime progression

SCAT RESEARCH (Systematic Commitment Abandonment Trauma):
├─ 2-prime failure: Unstable duality, no mother grounding
├─ 3-prime necessity: Triad prevents binary lockup
├─ 7-prime healing: Completion-as-transformation repairs abandonment
└─ Framework provides map out of institutional trauma patterns

KA PRESSURE DYNAMICS:
├─ Each prime state has characteristic Ka signature
├─ Gravity (grounding), EMF (energy), Affinity (attraction), Synergy (multiplication)
├─ Can measure transitions through Ka pressure shifts
└─ Higher primes = higher Ka complexity

ONE HERTZ CONCEPTS:
├─ Natural rhythm of development respects prime gaps
├─ Can't force +4 transition at +1 pace
├─ Sustainable presence over speed throughout
└─ Framework prevents burnout by honoring natural timing

PRIMORIS MYTHOLOGY:
├─ Tree lineage parallels prime progression
├─ Geological time mirrors awareness development
├─ Breaking/scattering = 2-prime shadow phase
└─ Return/restoration = 17-prime heritage phase

ACHIEVEMENT & CHEST SYSTEMS:
├─ Gamification of prime progression
├─ Trackable milestones prevent discouragement
├─ Wood unlocks = capability recognition
└─ Chest access = demonstrated competency
