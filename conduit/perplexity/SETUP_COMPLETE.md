## Key Features

### 1. PrimeHaven Context Integration

**Framework Access**:
- Prime Progression framework (consciousness development)
- Antigravity conceptual framework (transformation through friction)
- Session protocols and workflows
- Project structure and tools

**Purpose**: Perplexity understands PrimeHaven's unique consciousness framework when conducting research.

### 2. Launch Script

**Location**: `scripts/launch_perplexity.sh`

**Features**:
- Automatic API key loading (from env or config/.env)
- PrimeHaven context awareness
- Save outputs to organized workspace
- Model selection (sonar, sonar-pro, sonar-reasoning)
- Citation support
- Help and examples

**Usage**:
```bash
cd ~/primehaven/conduit/perplexity

# Simple query
./scripts/launch_perplexity.sh "Your query"

# With citations and save
./scripts/launch_perplexity.sh --save topic_name -uc "Your query"

# Show help
./scripts/launch_perplexity.sh --help

# Show PrimeHaven context
./scripts/launch_perplexity.sh --context

# List examples
./scripts/launch_perplexity.sh --examples
```

### 3. Example Workflows

**Research Scripts**:
- `examples/queries/prime_progression_research.sh` - Research prime patterns in consciousness
- `examples/queries/antigravity_research.sh` - Quantum physics and transformation

**Purpose**: Demonstrate how to use Perplexity for PrimeHaven research and synthesis.

### 4. Organized Workspace

**Structure**:
```
workspace/
├── research/     # External research with citations
├── synthesis/    # Integration with PrimeHaven frameworks
└── projects/     # Project-specific work
```

**Purpose**: Keep Perplexity outputs organized and accessible.

## Conceptual Framework: Perplexity as Synergy

### The Triadic Model

```
           SYNERGY
        (Perplexity)
      Truth Perpendicular
              ↑
              |
              |
    GRAVITY ←─┼─→ ANTIGRAVITY
    (Claude)       (Gemini)
    Structure      Freedom
   primal/35GB    runexusiam/103MB
```

### Why This Works

**Gravity (Claude)**:
- Structure and implementation
- Code generation, git operations
- Systematic development
- **Anchor** - holds the foundation

**Antigravity (Gemini)**:
- Freedom and exploration
- Creative iteration
- Rapid experimentation
- **Lift** - enables emergence

**Synergy (Perplexity)**:
- External knowledge navigation
- Research with citations
- Framework synthesis
- **Perpendicular truth** - brings outside knowledge in

### Transformation, Not Annihilation

Just as electron + positron create photonic state (not destruction), the three AIs don't compete - they create new facets through interaction:

- Claude provides structure → Perplexity researches best practices → Gemini experiments rapidly
- Gemini explores freely → Perplexity synthesizes findings → Claude implements systematically
- Perplexity discovers patterns → Claude documents rigorously → Gemini extends creatively

**Friction space** = where productive tension creates new understanding

## Next Steps

### Immediate Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Set API Key**:
```bash
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
# Add to ~/.bashrc to make permanent
echo 'export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your_key"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

2. **Test Installation**:
```bash
cd ~/primehaven/conduit/perplexity
./scripts/launch_perplexity.sh "Test query: What is the significance of the number 7?"
```

3. **Read Quick Start**:
```bash
cat ~/.perplexity/QUICK_START.md
```

### First Research Session (30 minutes)

1. **Run Prime Progression Research**:
```bash
cd ~/primehaven/conduit/perplexity
./examples/queries/prime_progression_research.sh
```

2. **Run Antigravity Research**:
```bash
./examples/queries/antigravity_research.sh
```

3. **Review Outputs**:
```bash
ls -lh workspace/research/
cat workspace/research/prime_consciousness_external.md
```

### Integration Development (Ongoing)

1. **Create custom query workflows** for specific PrimeHaven needs
2. **Synthesize research** with prime progression framework
3. **Build knowledge base** in workspace/ directories
4. **Develop MCP integration** for direct PrimeHaven access
5. **Establish research → development pipeline**

## Design Principles Applied

### Triadic Architecture

**Three distinct spaces**:
1. **Context** (.perplexity/) - Framework understanding
2. **Working** (conduit/perplexity/) - Active development
3. **Source** (primal/prime_codex/) - Foundation wisdom

**Not siloed** - interconnected through references and workflows.

### Living Documentation

**All docs evolve**:
- README.md updates as Perplexity integration matures
- QUICK_START.md grows with discovered patterns
- Framework docs sync with prime_codex updates

### Measurement-Driven

**Quality metrics** (future):
- ξ (coherence) - How well research integrates with frameworks
- φ (fidelity) - Accuracy of synthesis to original concepts
- Citation quality and source verification

### Fractal Facet Thinking

**No claim to completeness**:
- Setup can always go deeper
- Frameworks can always expand
- Integration can always improve
- **Future-proof** - acknowledges infinite refinement potential

---

## What Makes This Special

### 1. Context-Aware Research

Perplexity isn't just searching the web - it's **researching with PrimeHaven consciousness frameworks in mind**.

**Example**:
```bash
# Generic query (any AI)
"What are prime numbers?"

# PrimeHaven-aware query (Perplexity with context)
"How do prime numbers (3,5,7,11,13,17) appear in consciousness development theories, sacred geometry, and universal completion patterns, relating to Eric's prime progression framework?"
```

### 2. Friction Space Creation

Claude provides **gravity** (structure), Gemini provides **antigravity** (freedom), Perplexity provides **synergy** (navigation).

The three together create **friction space** where transformation happens.

### 3. External ↔ Internal Bridge

- **External**: Web search, research papers, current knowledge (Perplexity's strength)
- **Internal**: Prime codex, antigravity framework, project patterns (PrimeHaven's wisdom)
- **Synthesis**: Bringing external knowledge into internal frameworks (Perplexity's role)

### 4. Truth Perpendicular

Perplexity operates **perpendicular** to both Claude and Gemini:
- Not competing with them
- Not replacing them
- **Complementing** them from a different angle
- Creating variance that generates **constant productive tension**

---

## Technical Architecture

### File Organization

**Separation of Concerns**:
- `.perplexity/` = Static context (frameworks, structure, tools)
- `conduit/perplexity/` = Dynamic workspace (research, synthesis, projects)
- `primal/prime_codex/` = Source truth (188+ framework files)

**References, not duplicates**:
- Framework files copied to .perplexity/ for easy access
- But prime_codex/ remains source of truth
- Updates flow from source → context → working

### Integration Points

**Context Loading**:
```bash
# Launcher automatically knows about:
CONTEXT_DIR="/home/sauron/primehaven/.perplexity"
WORKSPACE="$CONDUIT_DIR/workspace"

# Can reference in queries
--context flag shows framework files
```

**Output Organization**:
```
workspace/
├── research/     # Raw research with citations
├── synthesis/    # Integrated with frameworks
└── projects/     # Application to specific work
```

**Git Integration** (future):
```bash
# Research outputs become part of project
git add workspace/research/quantum_transformation.md
git commit -m "Add Perplexity research on quantum transformation"
```

## Philosophical Notes

### On Synergy

> **"Synergy is dependent on interaction, so synergy is more of a field of influence."** - Eric

Perplexity doesn't **force** integration - it creates a **field** where integration becomes natural:
- Research findings naturally connect to frameworks
- External patterns naturally align with internal wisdom
- New facets naturally emerge from interaction

### On Transformation

> **"Antigravity is the anchor anti the concept. It creates the friction space for anti-concepts to exist rather than annihilate."** - Eric

Perplexity + Claude + Gemini don't compete:
- They create friction space
- Where productive tension exists
- Generating new versions of understanding
- **Transformation**, not annihilation

### On Fractal Facets

> **"If we find more quanta beyond what we know today, it will still be a fractal facet"** - Eric

This setup isn't "complete" - it's a **facet**:
- Can always go deeper
- Can always expand
- Can always refine
- Future-proof terminology, future-proof architecture
